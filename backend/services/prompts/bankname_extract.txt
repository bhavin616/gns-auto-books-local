Bank Name Detection Patterns

This prompt helps identify bank names in text strings, particularly in CSV "Split" columns.

Detection Rules:
1. Bank names can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of the text
2. Bank names may be followed by account type indicators: "Chk", "Checking", "Savings", "Business", "Credit", etc.
3. Bank names may be followed by account numbers, hash symbols (#), or masked numbers (XXXX)
4. Case-insensitive matching (e.g., "wells fargo" matches "Wells Fargo")
5. Common suffixes after bank names: account numbers, "#", "Chk", "Checking", "Savings", "Business", "Credit", etc.
6. If a string contains a known bank name pattern, it should be identified as a bank-related entry

Format patterns to look for:
- "[Bank Name] [Account Type] [Account Number/Masked Number]"
- "[Bank Name] #[Account Number]"
- "[Bank Name] [Account Type] [Number] [Additional Text]"
- "[Bank Name] [Number] [Account Type]"

Examples of bank entries to filter out:
- "Wells Fargo Chk XXXX8615"
- "Wells Fargo #3468"
- "WELLS FARGO CHECKING 7567 old"
- "Bank of America Checking 1234"
- "Chase Business #5678"
- "BMO Savings 9012"
- "US Bank Checking XXXX3456"

Examples of non-bank entries to keep:
- "Office Supplies"
- "Rent Payment"
- "Utilities"
- "Payroll"
- "Vendor Payment"
